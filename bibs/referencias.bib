    abstract = "Fake news spreading through media outlets poses a real threat to the trustworthiness of information and detecting fake news has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Fake news is typically written intentionally to mislead readers, which determines that fake news detection merely based on news content is tremendously challenging. Meanwhile, fake news could contain true evidence to mock true news and presents different degrees of fakeness, which further exacerbates the detection difficulty. On the other hand, the spread of fake news produces various types of data from different perspectives. These multiple sources provide rich contextual information about fake news and offer unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this paper, we study fake news detection with different degrees of fakeness by integrating multiple sources. In particular, we introduce approaches to combine information from multiple sources and to discriminate between different degrees of fakeness, and propose a Multi-source Multi-class Fake news Detection framework MMFD, which combines automated feature extraction, multi-source fusion and automated degrees of fakeness detection into a coherent and interpretable model. Experimental results on the real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and extensive experiments are further conducted to understand the working of the proposed framework.",

abstract = {Over the recent years, the growth of online social media has greatly facilitated the way people communicate with each other. Users of online social media share information, connect with other people and stay informed about trending events. However, much recent information appearing on social media is dubious and, in some cases, intended to mislead. Such content is often called fake news. Large amounts of online fake news has the potential to cause serious problems in society. Many point to the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign as having been influenced by fake news. Subsequent to this election, the term has entered the mainstream vernacular. Moreover it has drawn the attention of industry and academia, seeking to understand its origins, distribution and effects. Of critical interest is the ability to detect when online content is untrue and intended to mislead. This is technically challenging for several reasons. Using social media tools, content is easily generated and quickly spread, leading to a large volume of content to analyse. Online information is very diverse, covering a large number of subjects, which contributes complexity to this task. The truth and intent of any statement often cannot be assessed by computers alone, so efforts must depend on collaboration between humans and technology. For instance, some content that is deemed by experts of being false and intended to mislead are available. While these sources are in limited supply, they can form a basis for such a shared effort. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the finding to date relating to fake news. We characterize the negative impact of online fake news, and the state-of-the-art in detection methods. Many of these rely on identifying features of the users, content, and context that indicate misinformation. We also study existing datasets that have been used for classifying fake news. Finally, we propose promising research directions for online fake news analysis.}

abstract={In the last years, the popularity of smartphones and social networks has been contributing to the spread of fake news. Through these electronic media, this type of news can deceive thousands of people in a short time and cause great harm to individuals, companies, or society. Fake news has the potential to change a political scenario, to contribute to the spread of diseases, and even to cause deaths. Despite the efforts of several studies on fake news detection, most of them only cover English language news. There is a lack of labeled datasets of fake news in other languages and, moreover, important questions still remain open. For example, there is no consensus on what are the best classification strategies and sets of features to be used for automatic fake news detection. To answer this and other important open questions, we present a new public and real dataset of labeled true and fake news in Portuguese, and we perform a comprehensive analysis of machine learning methods for fake news detection. The experiments were performed using different sets of features and employing different types of classification methods. A careful analysis of the results provided sufficient evidence to respond appropriately to the open questions. The various evaluated scenarios and the drawn conclusions from the results shed light on the potentiality of the methods and on the challenges that fake news detection presents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},
